 PROJECT TITLE: ResidentConnect. 
 
Problem Statement: 
In most residential communities and apartment complexes, residents 
struggle with managing day-to-day issues such as water leakages, power 
outages, waste collection delays, or security complaints. At present, these 
problems are usually reported through phone calls, registers, or WhatsApp 
groups, which often leads to miscommunication, delays, and lack of 
accountability. Similarly, monthly utility bills like water, electricity, and 
maintenance charges are tracked manually, making it difficult for both 
residents and community administrators to monitor payments and overdue 
bills. Service teams also face challenges in tracking requests, prioritizing 
urgent issues, and updating residents about the status of their work. This 
unstructured process results in frustration for residents, inefficiency for 
service providers, and confusion for administrators.
